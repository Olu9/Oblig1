        <hr>
        <p>In this section, the semantic tags used will be explained. I will also explain why I decided to include the different parts of my content and discuss why the html elements used to annotate them were the best option.</p>
        <h2>Semantic tags used in this project</h2>
        <h3> &lt;main&gt; </h3>
        <p>The main was used for the main content on the page. Other major semantic tags will then be used inside the main. In other words, the main houses the other tags. 
            however, tags such as header and footer fall outside main
        </p>
        <h3>&lt;figure and  figcaption&gt; </h3>
        <p>This tags were used to mark up a photo in a document, and a figcaption element to define a caption for the photo</p>
        <h3>&lt;section&gt;</h3>
        <p>This was used to differentiate the texts from the image, when writing texts for the projects in the portfolio page</p>
        <h3>&lt;navs&gt;</h3>
        <p> Navs were used for navigation links. These tags were used especially in the creation of the homepage.</p>
        <h2>HTML elements used</h2>
        <p>A number of html elements were used in the making of this website. The appropriate elements were used for the headings, to convey priority for example. Blockquote was used for quotes. This to improve readability.
        Divs were used to group elements together
         to create classes. </p>
